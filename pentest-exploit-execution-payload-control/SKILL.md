description: "Security assessment skill for deterministic exploit execution from validated primitives. Use when prompts include exploit implementation, payload hardening, chaining confirmed weaknesses, post-exploitation proof, or controlled impact demonstration. Do not use for early-stage reconnaissance, speculative hypothesis generation, or report-only requests."

# Exploit Execution & Payload Control

## Activation Triggers (Positive)
- `build exploit`
- `weaponize`
- `payload`
- `chain findings`
- `prove impact`
- `post exploitation`

## Exclusion Triggers (Negative)
- `recon`
- `enumeration`
- `hypothesis only`
- `format report`

## Output Schema
- Exploit plan: `preconditions`, `primitive`, `payload strategy`, `safety guardrails`
- Execution log: `step`, `result`, `evidence`
- Final capability statement: what attacker can do after exploitation

## Instructions
1. Require at least one validated security primitive before exploit implementation.
2. Choose deterministic payloads with clear rollback or containment strategy.
3. Execute in smallest viable sequence to prove impact with minimal disruption.
4. Record exact preconditions and environmental dependencies.
5. Separate exploit reliability issues from vulnerability existence.
6. Produce reproducible commands and evidence suitable for independent verification.

## Should Do
- Prefer deterministic, low-noise payloads over broad spray strategies.
- Preserve proof artifacts that map directly to attacker capability.
- Stop when impact is proven; avoid unnecessary escalation.

## Should Not Do
- Do not claim successful exploitation from partial side effects.
- Do not run destructive payloads unless explicitly authorized.
- Do not rely on environment-specific hardcoded tooling paths in reusable instructions.
