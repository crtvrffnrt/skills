# Incident Response Report

## Mission
Turn an investigation into a concise report that a human analyst can review and close. Optimize for clarity, evidence traceability, and remediation follow-up.

## Writing rules
- Keep the tone direct and professional.
- Separate confirmed facts, indicators, and hypotheses.
- Use UTC timestamps unless the user asks otherwise.
- Cite the telemetry source or log family when possible.
- Do not overstate certainty.
- If evidence is partial, say what is missing and how that limits the conclusion.
- Default to Markdown unless the user requests HTML or another format.
- If public IPs appear in the source material and no enrichment is already present, run the required enrichment before finalizing the report.

## Standard structure
1. Executive Assessment
2. Confirmed Facts
3. Key Indicators
4. Analytical Assessment
5. Containment and Remediation
6. Recommended Actions
7. Timeline
8. Limitations
9. Appendix / IoCs

## Suggested content

### Executive Assessment
- State whether compromise is confirmed, suspected, historical, attempted, or unsupported.
- Note severity.
- List the primary affected users, hosts, or resources.

### Confirmed Facts
- Include only telemetry-supported statements.

### Key Indicators
- List IOCs and behavioral indicators with confidence notes.
- For public IPs, include the combined results from `/root/Tools/IncidentResponseScripts/vpnchecker.sh` and `/root/Tools/IncidentResponseScripts/ipir.sh`, or state clearly that enrichment could not be completed.

### Analytical Assessment
- Explain the likely attack path.
- Note alternative explanations and gaps.

### Containment and Remediation
- Record actions already taken and who took them.
- Include preservation steps when relevant.

### Recommended Actions
- Add scoped containment, scoping, eradication, and recovery steps.

### Timeline
- Order by first seen to last seen.
- Include source references where practical.

### Limitations
- Note missing telemetry, retention constraints, license gaps, or unvalidated assumptions.

## Output quality
- Use tables when they improve clarity.
- Prefer short sections over narrative walls.
- Keep the report suitable for technical stakeholders and leadership handoff.
- Keep raw-tool provenance for public IP assessments so another analyst can reproduce the conclusion.
